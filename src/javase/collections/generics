# unbounded wildcard -> ?
    - List<?> list -> means telling the compiler that we have no idea of what the type is
    - we can read from it as object, but can't write to it
    - List<?> list = Arrays.asList("Hello", LocalDate.now(), 3)
    - list.size() or list.forEach(Consumer) will work but list.add(...) will not
    - In the List<E> interface we have: boolean containsAll(Collection<?> c)
    - So List<?> only allowed methods are the methods that don't need type or methods from Object class


# upper-bounded wildcard -> ? extends SomeClass
    - can define, can read but can't add
