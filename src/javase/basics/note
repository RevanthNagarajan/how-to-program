# Class
    - Class is used to defined shape and nature of object. So Class is the blueprint of Object.
    - Any logic or behaviour we wish to implement should be encapsulated within the class.
    - Object -> object is the instance of class.
    - Class defines a new data type, known as User Defined Data Type.
    - The data, or variables, defined within a class are called instance variables.
    - Collectively, the methods and variables defined within a class are called members of the class.
    - Variables defined within a class are called instance variables because each
      instance of the class (that is, each object of the class) contains its own copy of
      these variables.


# Data Type -> Primitive and User Defined
    - Primitive -> Value type
    - User Defined -> Reference Type

# this keyword always refers to current instance of object
